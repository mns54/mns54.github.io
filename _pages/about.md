* The Impact of Cartels on Productivity: A Concrete Example from Japan  
(with [Satoshi Imahie](https://sites.google.com/view/luciano-satoshi/home), [Kazuma Takakura](https://kazumatakakura.github.io/), and [Yasutora Watanabe](https://sites.google.com/view/yas-watanabe/))

      We study the impact of cartels on productivity using a plant-level dataset from the Japanese ready-mixed concrete industry, where cartels can be legally permitted. Our annual panel covers 1993–2004 with information on inputs, outputs, and the timing of cartel formation and collapse. After estimating the plant-level productivity, we implement a difference-in-differences analysis, and show that cartel collapse increases both plant-level and market-level productivity, while cartel formation has no effect. Furthermore, a triple-difference analysis reveals that productivity gains are more pronounced for less productive plants and those in markets with higher plant density. These results, combined with a dynamic decomposition findings showing that market-level improvements are driven by within-plant changes rather than reallocation and exit, suggest that the treatment effect of competition is the primary driver of productivity gains following cartel collapse.

      How are cartels sustained despite declining demand and firm exit? Standard repeated game theory predicts that cartels cannot be maintained when firms anticipate exit, as exiting firms have incentives to deviate just before exit without facing punishment. We develop a theoretical model showing that money transfers to exiting firms can sustain cartels through conditional transfers in firms' final period. Using novel data from Japan's ready-mixed concrete industry (1993-2004), where cooperatives engage in legally sanctioned cartels, we find evidence that declining future expected demand increases cartel collapse probability, cartels increase prices, and firm exit responds to demand conditions. These results are broadly consistent with our theoretical predictions.

      Medium-term growth prospects of Caribbean countries have weakened in recent years. We examine these trends by providing new estimates of potential GDP growth for the region. Our findings reveal a broad-based decline over time, driven by declining contributions from human capital and total factor productivity. Linking these factors to firm-level data, we identify significant scope for aggregate productivity gains through the efficient reallocation of resources between firms and the removal of firm-level structural obstacles. Addressing issues such as the cost and access to finance, workforce education, tax administration, and business licensing and permits are associated with higher aggregate welfare.
